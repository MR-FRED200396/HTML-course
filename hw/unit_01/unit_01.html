                >The Lockheed SR-71 "Blackbird" is a long-range, high-altitude,
                strategic reconnaissance aircraft developed and manufactured by
                the American aerospace company Lockheed Corporation. It was
                operated by both the United States Air Force (USAF) and NASA.</i

            The SR-71 was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12
            reconnaissance aircraft during the 1960s by Lockheed's Skunk Works
            division. American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly" Johnson was
            responsible for many of the aircraft's innovative concepts. The
            shape of the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of
            the first aircraft to be designed with a reduced radar
            cross-section. At one point, a bomber variant of the aircraft was
            under consideration, before the program was focused solely on
            reconnaissance. Mission equipment for the reconnaissance role
            included signals intelligence sensors, a side-looking airborne
            radar, and a photo camera; the SR-71 was both longer and heavier
            than the A-12, allowing it hold more fuel as well as a two-seat
            cockpit. The SR-71 designation has been attributed to lobbying
            efforts by USAF Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay, who preferred
            the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation over simply RS
            (Reconnaissance). The aircraft was introduced to operational service
            in January 1966.
