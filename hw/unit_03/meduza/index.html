                    At the end of May, an accident took place at a combined heat
                    and power plant in the Arctic city of Norilsk, in Russia’s
                    Krasnoyarsk Krai. Approximately 20,000 tons of diesel fuel
                    spilled out of a reservoir and spread into the surrounding
                    soil and waterways. Nearly all of the tributaries of the
                    Daldykan and Ambarnaya rivers around the plant are now
                    contaminated with petroleum products. Greenpeace Russia
                    estimates that there is at least $86.3 million in damage to
                    bodies of water in the region alone. After taking several
                    days to respond to the accident, officials in the
                    Krasnoyarsk Krai declared a federal level emergency
                    situation on June 3. Two days later, Russia’s Emergencies
                    Ministry declared that the spill had been contained. Here’s
                    what the spread of the giant fuel spill looks like from
                    space.
